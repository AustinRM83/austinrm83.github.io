                    I have finished or started many projects throughout my high school career. Despite my focus being in
                    Computer Science, I also have many 3D designing projects such as mini figs, phone cases, respberry Pi
                    cases, and many other things. Listed below are both my programming and 3D modeling projects.

                    I started this project back in the summer before my freshman year of college started and have been working
                    on it since. My first idea to go about it was to use MagicMirror^2 and then create my own modules to attach
                    on my own "Magic Mirror," but my main problem with MagicMirror^2 was constricted module placement. The second
                    idea was to create my own software using the same java library that MagicMirror^2 used, Electron. The biggest 
                    roadblock currently is Trello's outdated and scattered API documentation.
