                <h2>Here is a little more what I like doing in my freetime.</h2>
                <p>
                    I have finished or started many projects throughout my collegiate career. 
                    Despite my focus on Computer Science, I also have many 3D designing projects 
                    such as mini figs, phone cases, raspberry Pi cases, and many other things. 
                    Listed below are both my programming and 3D modeling projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Below are the programming languages that I know that best:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                    </ul>
                    Below are several programming languages that I want to learn either during my collegiate career 
                    or work career:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Php</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Song Finder</h2>
                <p>
                    This project started during the summer of 2019 and went on hiatus the following summer. 
                    This project aimed to get songs from a youtube playlist, create a list of their name 
                    and description, and find their original video. However, I had to put this project on 
                    hiatus due to my lack of programming knowledge of javascript and my college applications.

                <h2>Raspbery Pi Task Board</h2>
                <p>
                    This project started during the summer of 2020 and has been in progress ever since. This project aims to 
                    create a "smart board" that keeps track of my calendar events, to-do tasks, and the weather. This project 
                    is still pretty young because of the several programming languages that I transitioned through to find the 
                    best language.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Language: </b>Python</li>
                        <li><b>Library/APIs: </b>Tkinter</li>

                <h2>Twitch-Integrated Discord Bot</h2>
                <p>
                    This project started during the Summer of 2021 and was completed in the same summer. My goal for this project 
                    was to create a discord bot that keeps track of whenever a Twitch streamer goes live and announces when they 
                    went live in their discord server. I chose Python for this project since it seemed the most widely supported 
                    discord bot language available.
