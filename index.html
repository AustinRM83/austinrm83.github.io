                <h2>Here is a bit about me and what I love doing.</h2>

                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Laredo, Texas, and attended United High School under an Engineering Magnet Program. 
                    I am currently attending Texas A&M University as a freshman and plan to major in Computer Science Engineering. 
                    My interests are robotics, renewable energy, technological advancements, 3D modeling, and programming. My hobbies 
                    include cycling, playing video games with friends, playing D&D, programming, and 3D designing.
                </p>

                    My interest in robotics sprouted back in elementary when I saw students at my elementary school competing in First Lego 
                    League (FLL). I joined my first FLL team in fifth grade, and somehow we had made it to the regionals competition. Though 
                    our teams did not even make it past the preliminaries, our team's total annihilation didn't discourage me from taking part 
                    in robotics. It wasn't until high school that my skills would shine at being a 3D designer and programmer.<br>

                <p>
                    With my interest in programming and 3D designing, I have completed many projects including a Raspbery Pi 
                    daily calendar/task reminder, 3D printed minifigure tank, 3D printed Raspbery Pi case, and many more listed under 
                    my projects.
